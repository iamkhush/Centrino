Centrino for Biniary
========

It is a django app that

a) Allows upload of a csv(sample biniary.csv)and storage of these values in db

b) applies an algo to calculate <something> of the values

c) Uses Google Graph in order to show these values in a Table, Pie and Bar Chart

d) There is a drop down to change the input values , that changes the graphs and tables dynamically

e) Atlast, saves the values in another table.

The app is live at http://centrino.herokuapp.com. Please have a look. :)
